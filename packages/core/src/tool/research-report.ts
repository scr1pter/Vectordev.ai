// and a sub-question marked answered must have one; a sentence with a number, a date or a name and no citation is a
// warning, not a refusal. The report is saved as a held, private document of the brain, recalled only once the user
// keeps it; calling again saves the next version. The model gets back what was saved and the confidence of each
// section, not the whole rendered report. This runner has no research judge yet, so its reports are not judged.

- sections: up to 12, each with a heading and a body; subquestion names the sub-question a section answers.
- disagreements and open_questions: say honestly where sources disagree and what is still open.
- Every cited [N#] must be a note research_note saved, and a sub-question marked answered must have a note; otherwise the report is refused with what to fix. Sentences that state a number, a date or a name without a citation are listed for you to fix.
