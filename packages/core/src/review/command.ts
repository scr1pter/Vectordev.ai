  // "<!--" opens a comment that the next "-->" closes, but it may be literal text too (escaped, or a comment that a
  // Markdown flavour refuses), so both readings are followed. The reading also depends on where a block's text starts,
  // and any line of a paragraph may start a block (a list item, a heading, a table row), so the pass reads from the
  // start of every line to the end of the paragraph, and text that any of these readings makes code counts as code.

  // shows only as code. Code becomes "#", which is neither whitespace nor a boundary, so a mention glued to code does
  // not count either, and a comment that no reading makes code is removed. Every reading follows the same partners,
