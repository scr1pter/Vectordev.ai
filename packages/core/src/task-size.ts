// Sizes a request with no model call, so "hi" gets one direct reply and only work that the user or the agent calls large
// brings in high effort and the judge. The engine, the V2 runner, the app and desktop all use this one classifier.
//
// It is built so that a wrong guess costs little and can be undone:
// - Chat (one direct reply) is only a social message, and never while work waits on the user. It is offered one tool,
//   escalate, so a message misread as social goes on as Work.
// - Everything else is Work, at the provider's default effort. Standard is offered every tool, subagents included, and
//   the agent decides when a part is worth handing off. Light, a size only a sender picks, skips the to-do list and
//   launches nothing, but keeps control of the subagents already working.
// - Thorough (high effort for the agent, the judge, and a push to split the work) comes only from the user's own ask in
//   the message, from the agent's escalate call, or from a message that continues Thorough work. Never from words about
//   the work's scope. Thorough ends with its run: the next message is sized fresh unless the reply asked the user a
//   question or the message carries the work on.
// - The user's "no subagents" stops new launches for that request at any size, and never takes away control of the
//   subagents already working. Their "don't be thorough" only keeps the request at Work.
