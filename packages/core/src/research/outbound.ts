// The check on every search query and address research sends out (section 5.4). It checks for private text copied
// into a query by accident, and refuses a query only on a high-confidence signal, so ordinary research queries go out.
// A query or an address is refused when it holds:
// 1. a secret: a password, key or token that BrainScan finds by its shape, its name or a word beside it, or a value
//    BrainScan finds in the private context ("S3cretPassw0rd" from DB_PASSWORD=S3cretPassw0rd), whole: in the private
//    facts by its shape, its name or the words around it, and in the work only by its shape, an assignment, an
//    address's password, a login pair or "the password is X";
// 2. a run of RUN_WORDS words in a row that the private facts hold, or of WORK_RUN_WORDS that the work holds, not all
//    of them common words;
// 3. an email address, or a phone, card or account number (9 or more digits), from the private facts;
// 4. a private host from the private context: an intranet name (jira.acme.internal, build01.corp.lan), a private or
//    link-local IP address, or a host whose labels look internal (billing.acme-internal.io, db01.acme.io, and
//    jira.acme.com when the private facts have an email address at acme.com);
// 5. a local path in the user's home folder (/Users/<name>/, C:\Users\<name>\, ~<name>/), or with the user name as
//    one of its parts (D:\backup\<name>\ledger.db), or the working tree's own path when it has MIN_TREE_PARTS parts
//    or more. The user names are those of the home folder and working tree the run names (Context.home) and of the
//    home folders the private facts name; repository text names none.
// The user's typing clears any of 2 to 5, a public source of this run clears 2 and 3 (`strict` keeps a public source
// from clearing a number), and a search result on a host clears a host that only its labels made look internal.
// Nothing clears a secret, except one that only a word whose letters digits break up, in a sentence of the private
// facts about credentials, gave away ("claude-sonnet-4-5" of "sign in with Google, then route to claude-sonnet-4-5"):
// the user's typing or a public source that holds it whole clears that. Nothing else is refused: names of people and
// companies, identifiers, checksums and IDs the private context does not hold, public host names, the standard names
// and addresses of Docker, Kubernetes, cloud metadata, emulators and home networks, and numbers other than those of 3
// (dates, versions, years, quarters, ports, amounts) all go out.
//
// Its scope is copying, so some private text goes out by design: a copy shorter than RUN_WORDS words or made only of
// common words ("my wife is pregnant and due next month"), and a password that is one plain word ("swordfish"), since
// code gives such words to secret-sounding names as often ("password = hashed"). A long quote of a repository file or
// of tool output, such as an error message, is refused until a public source of the run holds it.
//
// It does not chase private text an agent encodes on purpose (digits spread over words, respellings) or paraphrases.
// Deliberate leaks are limited by how a run is built instead: an address must come from a search result, a page link
// or the user's text, researchers in Deep carry no private context, and memory writes are held after web content. The
// queries go to the search service the user set up and are shown in the Sources tab.
//
// Both sides are compared folded: NFKD without accents and invisible characters, any script's digits as ASCII, letters
// that look like Latin ones as Latin (WebFence.latin), and in lower case.
