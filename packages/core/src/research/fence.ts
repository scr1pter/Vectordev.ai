// new for every block, and only `</untrusted_web_page nonce="…">` with the same nonce ends it, so a page, which cannot
// know the nonce, cannot close it. Tags of Vector's own prompts are escaped in any spelling a page could use (look-alike
// letters, full-width forms, hyphens for underscores, Markdown's backslashes), so a page cannot open a block of
// Vector's either. Characters a reader would not see are removed, and lines that read as instructions to an AI are
// named after the block, in Vector's own words. A page saved whole for Grep and Read is fenced the same way, and both
// fence it again when they show it.
