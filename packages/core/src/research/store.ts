// Deep research's run store, one brain per repository: runs keyed by the root session, so researchers write into
// their parent's run, with the pages they read (S1, S2, ...), the notes whose quotes were found in those pages (N1,
// N2, ...) and the report.
//
// - Every page read is a brain document of origin web: private, held for the reason `web`, and its passages held one by
//   one too, so recall, search and citations never serve one, whoever approves what. Its passages are indexed by
//   keyword (BM25) at once. Only passages a note quotes, and the report, get vectors, embedded when the machine is
//   idle; reading 25 pages embeds about 80 passages rather than about 2,000.
// - The report is a held, private document of origin research. Keep makes it recallable for the owner, as any private
//   document is: never for a session a guest is in, nor for a model that may train on prompts. Calling the report
//   again saves the next version, held again until it is kept.
// - Quotes are checked against the run's own saved text (`quoted`), since the brain's own quote check refuses held
//   documents, which these are.
// - A run nobody kept is deleted after 30 days. Research in a repository is capped at 1 GB; past it, the oldest runs
//   nobody kept go first, and the add says so. A run keeps at most 80 sources and 40 MB of their text.
// - Forget (a source, a run, all of a repository's research) deletes the text and leaves tombstones, so a later run
//   does not keep a forgotten page again on its own.
// - A run a guest acted in keeps nothing in the brain: it lives in a brain in this process's memory, which is gone
//   when the process ends. Its report stays in the session's transcript.
