// Vector's loopback egress proxy for the research browsers (section 5.6a). Nothing starts it yet: phase W3 starts it
// in desktop main, points each research partition at it with `session.setProxy`, and answers Electron's `login` for it
// with the secret. Only a client that sends that per-launch secret may use it, since any program on this computer can
// reach loopback, the ones the agent runs included (Web access None allows loopback). For each request a client with
// the secret sends it, a CONNECT tunnel or an absolute http URL, the proxy:
// 1. decides it as a `research-browser` request under Vector Local, before any lookup, and logs it;
// 2. refuses a host that is on this computer or the user's network by its name or address;
// 3. resolves the name itself and refuses it when any address it gets is loopback, private, link-local, CGNAT, ULA,
//    a cloud metadata address or another address that is not public (WebFetchRequest.isPrivateAddress);
// 4. refuses a port that is not a web port (80, 443, 8080 or 8443), so a tunnel never reaches another kind of server;
// 5. asks `admit`, such as the run's per-host rate limits;
// 6. connects to the address it checked, not the name, so a second answer from DNS (rebinding) cannot change where it
//    goes. A tunnel carries the browser's own TLS, so the site's certificate is still checked against its name.
// Steps 2 to 5 apply whether Vector Local is on or off. The secret is never passed on, and a site's 407 is answered as
// 502. If the proxy cannot start, research browsers do not open. Phase W3 wires this one into desktop main and writes
// no second proxy.
