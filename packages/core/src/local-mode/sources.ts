That covers Vector's worker threads: the threads of a process share one policy and one log, so the blocks of the terminal UI's main thread and of its workers are in the engine's log. The brain's reader is sealed instead: it refuses every connection off this computer and logs none, since it makes none of its own. Worker threads are covered under Bun when started through the global Worker or the worker_threads module, and under Node when their first import is the guard, as the brain's reader's is. The guard does not see Bun.fetch, a fetch, WebSocket or Bun.connect kept from before it started, Bun.SQL or Bun.RedisClient, or under Bun the ws package, whose one use in Vector (the OpenAI WebSocket transport) decides each model call itself, pooled sockets included, and the undici package, whose fetch is Bun.fetch there, so the GitHub requests of vector github are not seen. A request for a model server on your list on this computer or your network goes direct: one the proxy settings would still send to a proxy is refused, with a note to add its host to NO_PROXY. A listed server with an internet name may go through your company's proxy. The terminal UI's syntax highlighting downloads grammars from github.com in a worker thread, so with Vector Local on, including when it is turned on while the terminal UI runs, those downloads are blocked and logged",

Some traffic happens below that and is not in the network log. Chromium may look up a name a page links to before the request Vector refuses: Vector Local turns that name prefetching off when Vector starts, so after Vector Local is turned on it stops only once Vector restarts. A page can still have Chromium look up and connect to a host it names with a preconnect link, without sending a request, and Vector Local does not stop that. With Vector Local on, WebRTC uses no UDP. Its TCP goes through a research browser's proxy, and Vector's own windows run only the app. The agent's browser has no WebRTC peer connections and no WebTransport in its pages, in the frames they make and in their dedicated workers, but a shared or service worker a page starts still has WebTransport, and its connections are not in the network log. QUIC is off from the next start. The Electron smoke checks the agent's browser on macOS; it has not run on Windows or Linux yet. A system set to find its proxy itself (WPAD or a proxy setup file) has Chromium fetch that file. The operating system checks the certificates of the sites the windows load (revocation lists and OCSP on macOS and Windows). On Windows and Linux, Vector Local points Chromium's spellcheck dictionary downloads at this computer",
