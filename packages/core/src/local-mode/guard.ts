// The backstop under Vector Local's labelled call sites. This is the one place Vector patches globals on purpose. It is
// the first import of every entry point (the CLI, the TUI's engine thread, the desktop's engine and main process, and
// the brain's background reader), so no module captures an original before it is wrapped.
//
// It wraps fetch (and fetch.preconnect), WebSocket, Bun.connect, `net.Socket.prototype.connect` (which net, tls,
// node:https and Node's own fetch use) and, under Bun, the start of a node:http client request, whose client goes
// through Bun's native fetch past the other wraps. Each connection is decided by its destination before it is made:
// - A labelled call site (Egress.fetch, EgressHttpClient, the research browsers' proxy) decides its own request and
//   runs it in an attribution scope that grants that request's destinations; only those pass as that request, so
//   code that runs inside an inherited scope cannot reach an unrelated host.
// - Anything else is purpose `unknown`: with Vector Local on it reaches only this computer and the model servers on
//   the list, and is otherwise blocked and logged with the first stack frame outside this file.
// - fetch follows redirects itself, so every hop is decided before it is made.
// - A proxy is decided as a way off this computer: fetch is decided on its target URL before it reaches a proxy, and
//   at the socket layer a connection to a configured proxy (HTTP(S)_PROXY, ALL_PROXY, a fetch's `proxy` option) counts
//   as the internet, so an unlabelled request through a corporate proxy is still blocked. Node only uses the proxy
//   environment once `http.setGlobalProxyFromEnv` ran; treating the proxy as the internet is right either way.
// - Only a request for the internet may go through the proxy environment. One for this computer or your network (a
//   local model's prompt included) goes direct: its host joins NO_PROXY before it is sent (`direct`), in the exact
//   spelling Bun matches, which fetch reads at each request, and the proxy is never granted to it, so a client that
//   still sends it there (Node's node:http agent reads the environment once) is refused at the socket. Under Bun,
//   whose fetch and node:http client reach a proxy natively, past the socket wrap, a request for this computer or
//   your network that the proxy environment would still carry, as Bun reads it, is refused before it is sent, and
//   logged as refused, never as sent.
// - A Bun worker's fetch does not read the proxy settings its own process.env shows (Bun 1.3). It reads its starting
//   thread's as they were when it started, except that a variable the process started with keeps the value it
//   started with; and given an `env`, as every Worker the guard wraps is, it ignores both that and what the worker
//   writes later. So in a worker `carried` reads the settings its starting thread worked out for it
//   (`fetchEnvironment`), and `direct` there changes nothing for its own fetch. Before a Worker starts, its starting
//   thread puts this computer, and while Vector Local is on the model servers on the list, on its NO_PROXY, which
//   reaches the worker unless the process started with NO_PROXY set. A request the worker's settings would still send
//   to a proxy, such as one for a server listed after it started, is refused there with the NO_PROXY advice.
// - A model server on the list whose name is an internet name (`gpu.corp.example.com`) counts as the internet here, so
//   it may go through the company's proxy like any other request for the internet. Whether a listed server should go
//   direct whatever its name is the owner's decision; until then this is how it works.
// - A name allowed because its name says where it is (`localhost`, `nas.local`, `box.tail1.ts.net`) must resolve
//   there: a socket's lookup that answers outside is refused before anything connects, and fetch and Bun.connect
//   look the name up first. A name on the model server list is decided on the list instead, since a company's
//   `gpu.internal` may sit on its own public range; a loopback name must still resolve to loopback.
// - fetch reaches only http, https, file, data and blob addresses; any other scheme (Bun's s3:, whose name is a bucket
//   and not where it connects) is refused while the guard decides connections.
// - Under Bun, every Worker started through the global `Worker` or the `node:worker_threads` module object preloads
//   these same wraps (guard-worker.ts) before its own code runs, with Vector Local on or off, and gets the policy in
//   effect through its environment. The threads of a process then keep one policy and one log between them (Egress),
//   so a Worker's blocked connection is in the log the app reads, and a policy that changes reaches every thread. A
//   worker entry that seals itself (`backstop-worker.ts`, the brain's reader) puts the strict guard in place of the
//   one the preload installed (`unfollow`), and a Worker started in a sealed thread is sealed too.
// With Vector Local off, each wrap costs one call and logs nothing; a Worker still preloads the wraps, to follow.
//
// Strict mode, for tests (VECTOR_TEST_EGRESS=strict), refuses any connection off this computer and throws. Under Bun it
// also runs a proxy of its own on 127.0.0.1 and points the proxy environment at it for every name but loopback's
// (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `[::1]` go direct), so Bun.fetch, a fetch captured before the guard was installed,
// node:http and a Worker's fetch are refused too, and it preloads its wraps in Workers started through the global
// `Worker` or the `node:worker_threads` module object. Node needs no such proxy: its fetch, node:http and WebSocket
// all connect through net, which the socket wrap decides. Node has no preload either, so a Node worker is guarded
// when its entry imports `backstop-worker.ts` first, as the brain's reader does. The variables that ask for strict
// mode (ENVIRONMENT) are read only from a source checkout, never in a release build or the desktop app, and never
// where the environment turns Vector Local on (`strictFromEnvironment`): the agent can set them for a nested `vector`,
// and they would loosen it.
//
// Neither mode covers:
// - UDP and DNS lookups themselves, and the connections of child processes (the programs the agent runs make their
//   own; in strict mode a child that keeps the proxy environment has its HTTP refused, but not its raw sockets);
// - Bun.fetch, which Bun makes read-only, and a fetch or WebSocket class captured before install, outside strict mode
//   (in strict mode Bun.fetch and a captured fetch go through the guard's proxy, but a captured WebSocket class
//   connects directly, since Bun's WebSocket does not read the proxy environment). Vector's own code never calls
//   Bun.fetch, which a test checks, and the guard is the first import of every entry point. Under Bun the `undici`
//   package's fetch is Bun.fetch, so the requests of the libraries that use it, such as @actions/github's Octokit
//   (`vector github`), are not seen either;
// - a Bun.connect captured before install, including `import { connect } from "bun"`;
// - Bun.SQL (postgres) and Bun.RedisClient, which connect natively;
// - in strict mode, Bun.fetch once a test sets NO_PROXY or a proxy variable of its own after install;
// - under Bun, a proxy variable or NO_PROXY that was deleted from the environment and set again: Bun's fetch never sees
//   the new value, so the guard empties a variable rather than deleting it, and nothing in Vector deletes one;
// - under Bun, a Worker class imported by name from node:worker_threads (`import { Worker } from ...`), even in a
//   module loaded after install, since Bun does not update named imports of built-in modules. In strict mode its fetch
//   still goes through the strict proxy. A worker entry that imports `backstop-worker.ts` first, as the brain's reader
//   does, is guarded however it was started. Under Node, named imports loaded after install see the wrapped class;
// - under Node, a Worker whose entry does not import `backstop-worker.ts` first, with Vector Local on: Node has no
//   preload, and the desktop's engine starts no worker but the brain's reader. Under Bun, a Worker in a build whose
//   worker preload is missing while Vector Local is on (the CLI's build carries it; strict mode refuses the worker);
// - under Bun, the lookup of a name a node:http client request uses: that request is decided by its name only;
// - under Bun, the lookup fetch makes itself after the guard checked a name allowed by its name: Bun's fetch cannot be
//   told to connect to the address the guard checked without changing the URL the caller sees, so a resolver that
//   answers differently the second time is not caught there (Node's sockets connect to the address they checked);
// - under Bun, the npm `ws` package: Bun replaces it with its own client, which keeps a WebSocket class of its own and
//   reads no global, so a `ws` socket is never seen here. Its one call site, the OpenAI plugin's ws.ts, decides each
//   socket itself before it opens (and phase L5's model-call gate decides the request first). Under Node, `ws`
//   connects through net and is decided.
