// without stopping the engine. The worker is started from its bundled source as an eval worker, which runs the same
// way under Bun (the CLI), Node and Electron's utility process (the desktop engine) and needs no second file inside the
// signed app. From source under Bun it starts from entry.ts itself. When no worker can start, or one keeps dying,
// documents are read on the main thread instead under tighter limits, and `status` says why.
//
// The same worker runs the local search model. Its files are sent once per worker, and every load is checked against
// the model's pinned canary vectors before a vector is used. A request's query goes ahead of the background queue, so
// it waits for at most the one passage being embedded. Embedding never runs on the main thread outside tests: once
// documents are read there, search stays with keywords and code links.
