// The Vector brain: one local store for everything durable that steers the agent. Files people write stay theirs and

// brain.db on this computer. Everything on the request path is deterministic code over a few hundred entries, so it
// costs no model call and adds tokens only when something is relevant:
//
// - Tier 0, `digest`: rules, MEMORY.md (to its budget), pinned entries and one index line, byte-stable for a session so
//   the provider's prompt cache keeps it. Nothing at all when there is nothing to say.
// - Tier 1, `recall` once per request message and `attach` when a file is read: BM25 over entries, within a budget set
//   by the request's size; nothing when nothing scores.
// - Tier 2, `search` and `get`: the memory tool, when the agent decides to look.
