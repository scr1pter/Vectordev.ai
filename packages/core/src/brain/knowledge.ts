// Documents in the brain: what the user gives Vector to know (a PDF, a Word file, a spec in Markdown, the repository's
// own docs), read on this computer into sections, passages and typed records, and kept in brain.db beside memory.
//
// - `add` checks a file and queues it; a drainer, one per process, reads it in the background reader and stores what it
//   read. A job is leased in the database, so the desktop engine and a CLI sharing brain.db never read a file twice.
// - Records keep their ids across versions of a document (they come from its lineage, kind and subject), so a new
//   version keeps what the user did to them; unchanged passages keep theirs too.
// - `recall` puts memory entries and document cards in one budget, found by keywords over a stored index that reads
//   only the rows of a request's own terms. A repository with no documents recalls exactly as it did before.
// - Cards are rendered from ids for every request and never saved in a transcript, so forgetting a document takes it
//   out of every later request, old sessions included.
// - Private documents (uploads, attachments, what the agent kept) are withheld where personal memory is: from sessions
//   a guest is in and from models that may train on prompts. A repository's own docs follow its memory.
