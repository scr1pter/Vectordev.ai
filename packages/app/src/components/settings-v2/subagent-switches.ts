// tool can no longer launch it and the @ list no longer offers it. A switch is

// one more update once it settles. A pick that matches the saved value is
// dropped, so flipping a switch off and back on saves nothing. A switch shows
// its latest pick until the save carrying it settles, so it never flicks back
// mid-save. `save` must resolve only once `saved` reads the new values (server
// sync writes the update's result into the config cache before it resolves).
// A failed save drops the picks it carried, so their switches return to the
