// Node runs an eval worker with module syntax as a module. It carries the build's version and channel like the rest of
// the build, so the egress guard inside it knows it runs in a build of Vector and ignores the test variables
// (EgressGuard.strictFromEnvironment), which whatever starts Vector could set. build.ts, build-node.ts and the brain worker
// smoke all bundle it here.
