// research_plan (section 5.4): proposes the plan, works out what it is likely to cost, and asks the user through the
// plan card (Start, Start deep or Cancel; a typed reply is a steer). The run starts in the store only once the plan is
// approved, so nothing is searched or read before. A call that only moves sub-questions along never asks again. In a
// child session (the build agent's research tool) and where no one can answer, the plan is approved on its own,
// within its launcher's size: only the user's own answer on the root plan card raises a run to Thorough (RC7). What the
// user ticks "Always" for on the card (the sites to prefer or avoid, the format) is kept as their preference, and every
// later plan carries it, marked as coming from their preferences.
