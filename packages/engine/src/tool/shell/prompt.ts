1. Directory Verification:
   - Before creating files or directories, establish that the parent is the intended location. Reuse a prior listing or successful read when it already establishes this; check with \`test -d\` in the same command if it is unknown.

2. Command Execution:
   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., rm "path with spaces/file.txt")
   - Examples of proper quoting:
     - mkdir "/Users/name/My Documents" (correct)
     - mkdir /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)
     - python "/path/with spaces/script.py" (correct)
     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)
   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.
   - Capture the output of the command.

Usage notes:
  - The command argument is required.
  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds. If not specified, commands will time out after ${defaultTimeoutMs}ms.
  - If the output exceeds ${limits.maxLines} lines or ${limits.maxBytes} bytes, it will be truncated and the full output will be written to a file. You can use Read with offset/limit to read specific sections or Grep to search the full content. Do NOT use \`head\`, \`tail\`, or other truncation commands to limit output; the full output will already be captured to a file for more precise searching.

  - Prefer Glob, Grep, and Read for individual searches and reads, and Edit or Write for manual changes. A bounded search or batch read of related files may use one shell command. Use a project runtime for repetitive edits, validating all matches before any writes. Communicate directly instead of printing progress with echo/printf.
  - When issuing multiple commands:
    - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple bash tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run "git status" and "git diff", send a single message with two bash tool calls in parallel.
    - ${chain}
    - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail
    - Multiline scripts are allowed; explicitly propagate failures before dependent operations.
  - AVOID using \`cd <directory> && <command>\`. Use the \`workdir\` parameter to change directories instead.
    <good-example>
    Use workdir="/foo/bar" with command: pytest tests
    </good-example>
    <bad-example>
    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests

1. Directory Verification:
   - Before creating files or directories, establish that the parent is the intended location. Reuse a prior listing or successful read when it already establishes this; check with \`Test-Path -LiteralPath <parent>\` in the same command if it is unknown.

2. Command Execution:

     - New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "My Documents" (correct)

     - & "path with spaces${pathSep}script.ps1" (correct)

   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.

You can use Read with offset/limit to read specific sections or Grep to search the full content. Do NOT use \`Select-Object -First\`, \`Select-Object -Last\`, or other truncation commands to limit output; the full output will already be captured to a file for more precise searching.

  - Prefer Glob, Grep, and Read for individual searches and reads, and Edit or Write for manual changes. A bounded search or batch read of related files may use one shell command. Use a project runtime for repetitive edits, validating all matches before any writes. Communicate directly instead of printing progress with Write-Output/Write-Host.
  - When issuing multiple commands:
    - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple bash tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run "git status" and "git diff", send a single message with two bash tool calls in parallel.
