// it may send are worked out here from the history of every session in the run, so they hold across restarts and are
// the same in every research tool:
// - the run is the newest plan the lead's session approved (research_plan's completed call carries its id);
// - provenance is the run's search results, the links research_read offered, and addresses the user typed;
// - the outbound check's private context is everything any agent of the run took in that is not known to be public:
//   the memory lines recalled, found or pinned for it whatever their scope (a researcher's how-you-work lines
//   included), MEMORY.md, the document titles and cards it was shown, every tool's output but the web's (files read,
//   commands run, a subagent's report, an MCP server's answer), files attached to a message, pages read in the user's
//   signed-in browser, pages read or fetched from the user's own network, and what the system prompts carry beside
//   the brain's digest (instruction files, agents' prompts set in config, references, MCP servers' instructions).
//   Only the root user's typed words are exempt: a sub-question, a task brief or a message to a task is written by an
