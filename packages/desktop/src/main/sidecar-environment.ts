// /proc/<pid>/environ on Linux), and an agent's shell command is such a
// process. Launched with Vector's own secrets, the sidecar would hand that
// command the Vector Cloud bridge token, which runs account actions without the
// prompts the agent's tool asks, and the vault key the cloud credentials are
// encrypted with. So `launch` keeps only what untrusted children may see, and
// `secrets` travel in the sidecar's start message, which sets them in-process
// where a launch-environment read cannot see them.
