/*
 * Keeps the computer awake while the local engine has work running.
 *
 * Idle sleep froze agents mid-run: on battery a Mac can sleep after a minute without input, and a sleeping machine
 * only moves its agents forward in brief dark wakes. While any session in the engine is busy or retrying, this holds
 * a power save blocker that lets the display sleep but keeps the system awake. Sleep the user asks for still happens:
 * closing a laptop's lid sleeps it whatever is running.
 *
 * Busy sessions are tracked here, from the engine's own event stream, and never from a window, whose stream is what
 * goes stale. Each connection is seeded from the status of every directory sessions have run in. The blocker is never
 * held on old news: once the stream has been down or silent for longer than `silenceMs` (the engine sends a heartbeat
 * every 10 seconds), it is released until a fresh connection has been seeded.
 *
 * Sessions the engine's V2 runner drains (a parallel workspace's Vector agent, a swarm's planner and workers) never
 * report a session.status, and nothing announces that a drain ended. The runner lists the drains it owns, so that list
 * is read with each seed, as soon as a session it does not know of shows V2 activity, and every `pollMs` while any
 * drain is known. Nothing polls it while nothing runs on it.
 *
 * Nor is it held for work that waits on the user. A session stays busy while a permission or question prompt is
 * unanswered, so a session with one does not count. Its parent, waiting on it as a foreground subagent, still looks
 * busy; so while any prompt is unanswered, the blocker is released once nothing has moved for `stalledMs`.
