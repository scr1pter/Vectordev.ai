// Vector Local in the desktop app (plan sections 4.2, 4.3.6, 4.7 and 4.9). Desktop main resolves the policy before
// app.whenReady from the folders its engine reads (local-policy.ts), and from then on:
// - Chromium: one dispatcher per session (egress-filter.ts), WebRTC kept to the proxy, no DNS prefetching, no QUIC,
//   no spellcheck downloads on Windows and Linux, and no WebRTC peer connections or WebTransport in the agent's
//   browser;
// - the company's certificate authorities are added to the certificates desktop main and its engine trust;
// - once the engine runs, desktop main compares its policy with the engine's (GET /local) as soon as the engine says
//   Vector Local changed (its local.updated event) and every half minute, reading its own folders again each time,
//   and when they differ it uses the stricter of the two and says so; a change applies to Chromium at once where it
//   can (WebRTC, spellcheck dictionaries, the agent browser's peer connections and WebTransport), and DNS prefetching
//   and QUIC, which only a start sets, say a restart is needed; and it sends what its own windows and requests did to
//   the engine's network log (POST /local/egress/report), so "What Vector sent" lists the desktop's requests too;
// - on the first run, with no company policy and no model connected, the requests Vector makes for itself at start
//   (the usage check-in, the update check, the dictation model's pre-warm, release notes, and in the engine the model
//   catalog's refresh, the free models and plans catalogs and the provider policy) wait until the person has chosen
//   how to run models, with no timeout, and go then;
// - the services desktop main reaches (usage, updates, the help assistant) ask Vector Local before they connect.
