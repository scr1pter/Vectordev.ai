// Every research agent's own browser (section 5.6a). The lead `research` agent and each `researcher` it starts drive
// one research browser apiece, through the engine's research_browser tool and the bridge's POST /research. A run (keyed
// by the run's ID, which the engine takes from its root session) has at most 1 + its researcher cap open at once; an
// agent past that waits for one to close. They live in their own map, apart from the visible agent browser's contexts,
// so a research command has no way to name a visible-browser page and a visible-browser command none to name these.
//
// Isolation:
// - Each browser is a WebContentsView of 1280x900 inside one hidden host window (as cloud-browser-check.ts does), with
//   background throttling off so pages finish loading. The host is never focusable and never in the taskbar, and it is
//   destroyed when the last research browser closes, so it neither keeps Vector open once its windows close nor is a
//   window anything can show. Its session is a slot from a pool of in-memory partitions,
//   `vector-research-<n>`: Electron has no call that frees a session, so a partition per run would keep each one until
//   Vector quits. A slot serves one agent at a time and shares no cookies, storage, cache or sign-in with the user's
//   browser or another slot. When its browser closes, its pages close and then every storage type (service workers
//   included), the cache, the auth cache, the host resolver cache and the open connections are cleared; a slot whose
//   clearing fails, or whose page is still alive 2 seconds after it was told to close, is retired. The pool grows to the
//   most browsers open at once and does not shrink; it is not a cap. Known residual: Electron has no call that clears a
//   session's HSTS entries, so a site that sets them can recognise the slot when a later agent's browser in it visits
//   (it learns that the visits came from the same Vector, which the network address often tells it anyway).
// - Sandbox, context isolation and web security on, Node off, no preload, dialogs off, no spellcheck, audio muted,
//   WebRTC only through the proxy (and stubbed), no webview tags, no plugins (so a PDF is a download), and no File
//   System Access pickers (the Blink feature is off in every frame of the page, and stubbed too). Every document
//   a research browser loads, each frame's included, gets a CSP `sandbox` without `allow-modals`, which a fresh frame
//   inherits and cannot undo: no print dialog, alert, confirm or prompt. Vector never focuses one; typing goes to the
//   field with the page told it has focus (DevTools focus emulation), so the user's window keeps the keyboard.
// - Every permission is denied, fullscreen included, and there is no display-media handler, so screen capture is
//   refused. Downloads are cancelled; a PDF is fetched again through the proxy into memory for the reader instead.
// - No credentials of any kind: a client-certificate request gets none, `login` is answered only for the browser's own
//   proxy, a site's NTLM or Negotiate challenge is cancelled before Chromium can answer it with the user's own Windows
//   or Kerberos sign-in, and certificate errors are never overridden. allowNTLMCredentialsForDomains is not used: Electron
//   applies it to the whole app, and an empty list is no list, so on Windows the system's own zone settings would still
//   decide which hosts get the user's sign-in.
// - Service worker scripts are cancelled in the network stack (their request carries a `Service-Worker` header), since
//   a script stub can be undone from a fresh frame; clearing a slot removes any registration.
// - A popup or target=_blank link loads in the same page when the navigation rule allows it.
// - Between commands the page's scripts are held in the DevTools debugger and run again for the next command, so a
//   hostile page cannot keep its scripts, timers or network callbacks running; file choosers are intercepted there, so
//   none opens. After a load or an action the page runs until it has made no request for half a second (at most 3
//   seconds), so a page built by script after its load event is built when it is held. A page that does not answer
//   within the command deadline is closed, and so is a browser whose page the debugger cannot attach to.
// - Fonts never load; images and media load only when the agent's model reads images. A page load may make at most
//   150 other requests and receive 20 MB, counted by the browser's own proxy as the bytes arrive (chunked and
//   compressed answers included), after which further requests are cancelled. An answer already arriving then may
//   finish, up to 40 MB for the page load, its own document included; past that the proxy ends the browser's
//   connections, so one endless answer cannot keep downloading while the page waits for its next command.
// - Every request goes through the browser's own proxy (research-proxy.ts). The navigation rule (research-navigation.ts)
//   runs in onBeforeRequest on every main-frame and subframe request and redirect hop, with the run's provenance, the
//   run's per-host rate limits for documents and robots.txt for what Vector discovered.
// - A browser closes when its agent's session finishes (the engine closes it), when its run is stopped, after 10 idle
//   minutes, or when its page stops answering.
//
// Electron keeps one listener per webRequest event per session, and Vector Local's Chromium dispatcher
// (egress-filter.ts) holds each session's onBeforeRequest: the navigation rule registers there as a step, which runs
// after Vector Local's own decision. The other webRequest events are this file's alone.
