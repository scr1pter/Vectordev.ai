    "Background subagents you can steer, Vercel and Supabase controls, project trust and per-run spend caps",
    "Vector now starts batches of up to eight subagents in the background by default, leaving the conversation available while they work. It can explicitly wait when it needs their results, inspect their latest activity, give them new instructions at a safe step, and stop selected tasks or the whole batch. Results that finish together arrive in one notification. The Background tasks panel brings subagents, team members, swarm workers and outside agents into one view, with activity, dependencies, elapsed time and recorded spend. Talk to this subagent sends a correction to a supported running agent; Ask Vector about this adds a progress question to your conversation. Unsupported controls stay unavailable, and missing outside-agent token or cost data is shown as unknown. Individual swarm workers can be stopped, including before they start; their dependent work stops too, and completed changes are retained. Subagents can receive compact context and dependency results instead of rereading whole conversations. Scoped messages have size and rate limits, explicit file edits respect assigned paths, and child and batch spend caps stay under the launching run's Run Guard. After an engine restart, interrupted tasks keep their records and partial results and require an explicit continuation. The new vector tasks commands and the TUI's /tasks panel inspect, message and stop work; headless vector run waits for background results with a finite timeout. These terminal features need the new standalone CLI release and are not added to an already installed older CLI or WSL engine by a desktop update. Offline scripted comparisons are published with the benchmark method; they do not establish live price, speed or quality parity. Vector Cloud now runs your Vercel and Supabase accounts from the workspace, and supports only those two: Netlify, the read-only AWS inventory and Vector's own hosted publish target are removed, so Vercel is the only place the agent publishes. A Netlify connection saved by an earlier version is deleted from this computer on first launch; the access you granted Vector stays on your Netlify account until you remove it there. For Vercel: projects, deployments with Promote, Roll back and Redeploy, environment variables and domains. Publishing now makes a preview unless you choose production, where 1.99.106 went straight to production, and Vector no longer adds a Deployed with Vector badge to your site's index.html. Domains are read from the Vercel project itself; the domain records earlier versions kept on this computer are no longer read. For the linked Supabase project: the database, with the exact SQL shown before it runs, migrations, storage limits, functions, logs and security checks, and a new organization when your account has none. Vector's migration history moves from public.vector_migrations to a private vector.schema_migrations table: on the next migration run Vector copies the old rows into your Supabase database's new table and drops the public one, counts migrations the Supabase CLI recorded as applied, and stops before applying anything if an applied migration file was edited. The agent has the same controls as the Cloud screens, and Logs, Database logs and Security can hand what they show to the agent. Every change to a cloud account asks each time, with no Always allow, even in automatic mode, and that includes vercel and supabase commands in the shell and release or settings buttons on their dashboards in Vector's browser. Disconnecting a sign-in also asks Vercel or Supabase to remove Vector's access, and says so when they did not confirm it. In a project you have not trusted, Vector ignores the project's own settings, commands and skills and does not start your language servers, formatters or MCP servers there. Nothing carries over from earlier versions, so after updating each project asks once: choose Trust project in the session header to load its settings again, and changing those settings asks again. Invited guests can no longer switch on tools in their own sessions, commit, switch branches or write inside .git, and they see and add to sessions only in their own workspace. Shell commands that read a .env file now ask like the read tool, a git diff that would print files outside the work tree is checked like a file read, file writes are checked where they really land, and an MCP server's sign-in opens only web pages. Vector's own helpers, such as Vectorscope reviews, Codespace edit and autocomplete, the Browser Agent planner and the swarm planner, stay inside the screen that started them and never show up as sessions, in session lists, notifications or session counts; the session that started them shows their tokens and cost, including for stopped and failed work. The Run Guard caps what one run spends: set it in Settings, Spend limits. Vector estimates each next step and stops before one that would cross the cap, within one step for each agent running, and subagents and helpers count against the same cap. Under a dollar cap, a model with no catalog price stops after 40 unpriced steps, and Vector Codium steps count as unpriced; free models and ChatGPT plan steps are not counted in dollars. An agent that gets the same result from the same tool call, or the same error, three times in a row is paused, a provider outage ends after 10 retries or 15 minutes, and the stop card says why and offers Continue. Sessions keep stable prompt prefixes so providers can reuse their caches, ChatGPT conversations can continue over a WebSocket connection, history is downloaded again less often, titles no longer hold up the first answer, an edit and its check can share one response, and Vector loads the packages for language servers, MCP, GitLab, PowerShell and telemetry only when they are used. Background subagents and agent swarms are steadier: Stop and Discard finish even when the engine stops answering, swarm workers merge into staging one at a time, a conflicting merge is refused before anything is written and one that stops part-way is undone, Resume no longer reruns a task that had already merged, and the computer stays awake while agents in parallel workspaces or their checks run. Vector Codium is built in for when sales open: a Vector Codium provider then appears in the model picker, Vector never picks it on its own, not even for an attached image, and Settings shows the share of this month's credits left and whether purchased credits are available, running low or used up, never an amount. The /codium page lists $10, $50, $100 and $200 monthly plans and top-ups, and its buttons say Coming soon until sales open. Models included with Vector, through your own free OpenRouter account or Vector's shared allowance while it is on, now follow a no-training policy: Vector offers only free models it has checked with the provider allowlisted to serve them, every request asks OpenRouter to deny data collection, and providers may still keep prompts under their own policies, as the model picker now says. Earlier versions used only zero-data-retention providers, so Vector tells you this once, the first time you send to one of these models. The branch button in the session header is a neutral chip again, and Vectorscope's pull request header and pull request numbers look as they did before 1.99.105. The bottom of the sidebar shows who is signed in, with your Google profile photo (or your initial) and your name or email, and opens Settings; signed out, it offers Sign in to Vector. A saved Light theme, or Follow system on a light system, now applies from launch rather than only after switching it in Settings, and a server's menu in Settings opens above Settings, so a server can be edited, made the default or deleted there. Sign in with ChatGPT remains available. The npm CLI stays at 1.99.99, and vectordev.ai/install currently installs a CLI build numbered 1.99.107 from 11 October, which predates these changes, so vector trust, vector codium, vector tasks, the TUI's /trust and /tasks, and vector run --max-cost and --max-steps arrive with the next CLI release. Windows WSL servers also keep running the 1.99.99 engine this desktop requires until a later desktop release requires the new CLI, so on a WSL server the shell prompts for cloud commands and .env reads, the git diff checks, project trust, the Run Guard, loop pauses and the new subagent controls do not apply yet. The guest limits apply to vector invite from the next CLI release, because vector invite runs from the CLI. This release is not yet code-signed, so a new install may show an operating-system warning on first launch.",

Pressing Stop on a subagent that already finished now settles its card and says so, instead of appearing to do nothing. Sign in with ChatGPT is back: connect OpenAI with a ChatGPT Plus or Pro account to use GPT models. Vector now sends a daily usage count: how many sessions and subagent sessions ran, and, when you are signed in, token totals, recorded cost, the models and effort levels used, and streaks, with the app version and operating system.

Stopping the agent's turn leaves the subagents it handed off running; stop them all from the background tasks panel.

Set up automatic reviews opens a pull request that adds the GitHub Actions workflow `vector github install` writes, on your agent's model, and lists the repository secrets to add; no API key is sent to GitHub, and Vector asks GitHub for permission to change workflow files only for this.

    "Pull Requests is now called Vectorscope, with the same icon, and its screen is redesigned. Reviews are more careful: after the review, a second pass re-reads the code behind every finding above a nit and drops the ones it cannot confirm, and the findings it keeps are marked Double-checked. The reviewers also read the failing CI checks for the commit under review, with the log of the step that failed, the places in your project that use the functions and types the pull request changes, and your project's rules in AGENTS.md (or CLAUDE.md) and .vector/RULES.md. A review runs on the model you last chose for the agent, and its progress line names that model; a model set in .vector/review.json still takes precedence. Comment, Request changes and Approve now post each finding on its own line, with GitHub's one-click suggested change when a fix is safe to commit; if GitHub refuses the line comments, the review goes out as one summary that lists every finding. Dismiss a finding with a reason to leave it out of what is posted, and choose Don't flag this again to save a project rule to .vector/RULES.md that later reviews follow. Fix with agent opens an isolated agent on the pull request's code with the finding as its task: it checks the problem is real, fixes it, runs the tests and commits without pushing.

In Settings, text boxes and buttons no longer sit directly on a section's dividing line, and the search field shows one frame instead of two. Built-in Sign in with ChatGPT is turned off until OpenAI authorizes it: connect OpenAI with an API key, or use the separately installed Codex runtime. If you signed in with ChatGPT before, Vector tells you once and stops using that sign-in. The Terms, Privacy Policy and Software License now name Krishna B / VectorDev.ai and keep your rights under the LGPL for the open-source libraries Vector includes. The terminal agent stays at 1.99.99. This release is not yet code-signed, so a new install may show an operating-system warning on first launch.",

    "Pull Requests now works with your GitHub sign-in in Vector, and nothing has to be installed. Open Pull Requests, choose Connect GitHub, enter the code it shows on github.com, and your repository's pull requests appear: list, open, read the diff, create, comment, approve, request changes and merge, and run a Vectorscope review, all from Vector. Failed GitHub Actions runs and their logs come through the same sign-in, cut down to the step that failed. This is the same GitHub sign-in Open from GitHub uses, and the token stays in your computer's keychain; Sign out of GitHub in the panel switches accounts. If the GitHub CLI is already signed in on your computer, Pull Requests uses that login without asking again. When an organization requires single sign-on or approval for Vector, the panel says where to authorize it. Links you click in Vector's browser now open, including Google search results, results that pass through a redirect and links that open a new tab; before, a click that led to another website did nothing. The agent still needs your approval for each new website it visits, and when it is stopped it now names the link so it can ask you for it. Release notes and Changelog in the app open the changelog in the documentation. The terminal agent stays at 1.99.99.

    "The Changes panel is redesigned. Each changed file is now one row with its name over its folder and its added and removed line counts, under a summary of every file's totals, and a row expands into a short preview of its first change. Opening a file fills the panel with a focused reader instead of a side-by-side diff next to a file tree: one column of line numbers, a + or − beside each changed line, word-level highlights, your line comments inline, and a header with Back, the file's counts, a pager across the changed files, Open in editor, and a menu for the full file, split view (when the panel is wide enough), the previous or next change and Copy path. Back or Esc returns to the list, and a second Esc closes the panel; < and > move between files, [ and ] between changes, and Cmd+F (Ctrl+F on Windows and Linux) finds within the diff. Diffs in the conversation and in file tabs look as before. Background tasks now opens as a floating window by default, beside the Changes panel when there is room; its dock button still docks it, and Esc closes it either way.

    "Besides opening a folder on your computer, you can now open a repository from GitHub: choose Open from GitHub on the Home screen or in the project menu, or press Shift+Cmd+O (Shift+Ctrl+O on Windows and Linux). Pick one of your repositories or paste a GitHub link, choose where to put it, and Vector clones it with a progress bar and opens it like Open Project. Public repositories work without signing in; connect GitHub to see your own and your organizations' repositories and to clone private ones. Vector uses your GitHub sign-in only for the clone and never writes it into the repository, its settings or Vector's logs, and a canceled or failed clone leaves nothing behind and never replaces an existing folder. Push to GitHub now lists only repositories you can push to, and on Windows Vector also finds Git for Windows installed after Vector started. The terminal agent stays at 1.99.99.

    "Messages work again in the desktop app",
    "This release fixes the desktop app, where in 1.99.99 every message failed with \"Bun is not defined\" on macOS, Windows and Linux. Local plugins and skills loaded from a URL failed in the desktop app with the same error, and plugins installed from npm and providers whose SDK Vector downloads on first use could not load there; all of them work now. The 1.99.99 apps for Intel Macs, Windows on Arm and Linux on Arm did not open, because they were built without the terminal component for their processor. 1.99.100 includes it on every platform, and a terminal component that cannot load now affects only terminals. A copy that does not open never reaches its update check, so on those computers download 1.99.100 from your account page or GitHub releases and install it over the old one; your projects and settings stay where they are. On Windows, Vector's Git commands now follow your Git line-ending and symlink settings: a file whose only change is its line endings no longer shows as edited or blocks switching an agent's branch, and Vector's commits keep the line endings your repository expects. Also on Windows, Claude Code and Codex installed with npm receive the whole Parallel Workspace prompt instead of only its first line, Cursor Agent installed as a command script says it cannot take the prompt instead of running with part of it, detecting these agents no longer fails when one of them or VS Code is installed as a command script, Publish finds Vercel and Netlify CLIs installed with npm, and merge and pull-request checks run npm, pnpm and yarn instead of skipping them. A failed agent check no longer repeats in a loop while the Parallel Workspace composer is open. On Linux, Restart in 1.99.99 and in-app updates to it could open a new, empty profile; 1.99.100 opens your original profile again, so anything you signed in to or set up only in that empty profile needs to be set up again. The terminal agent was not affected and stays at 1.99.99. This release is not yet code-signed, so a new install may show an operating-system warning on first launch.",

    "Vector is free, updates itself, and agents can change branch",
    "Vector is now free: create a free Vector account to download the desktop app, and the same account signs in the terminal agent. Installed copies now update from inside the app: choose Check for Updates and Vector downloads the new release, installs it and restarts. You can change an agent's branch: click the branch name in the session header to switch that checkout to another local branch, or type a new name to create one from the current commit. Vector never stashes or discards your work to switch, and it refuses while a Vector agent is running in that checkout; in agent workspaces Vector manages, you can create a branch but not switch to an existing one. 1.99.99 is the first release with no dependency on the upstream service. Connect a provider with your own API key, sign in with ChatGPT for OpenAI models, or use Connect OpenRouter with your own OpenRouter account; its eligible zero-price models appear under Free models inside of Vector and stop at their limits instead of switching to a paid model, and Vector's shared free allowance stays off. The model list is current again, including GPT-6 Astra, GPT-6 Sol, GPT-6.1 Sol and GPT-6 Luna for ChatGPT sign-in, and Vector refreshes it from vectordev.ai when it starts and every hour. On first launch after upgrading, Vector imports your 1.99.8 settings, agents, commands, skills, plugins, MCP servers and permission rules, and keeps the originals. Security fixes keep stored API keys, auth headers and MCP tokens out of what Vector's server sends to connected clients and invite guests (an invite guest still has full access to your workspace, including the terminal, so invite only people you trust), keep Vector's internal secrets out of the integrated terminal, and protect passwordless local servers from rebinding web pages. Cloud connections keep client secrets on Vector's server, project variables keep their names when you change projects, local .env writes preserve literal values, and agent publishing uses one linked destination or asks you to choose; registration of the Cloud sign-ins is still pending. Reliability: stopping a prompt during first startup no longer leaves later prompts stuck, search recovers after an interrupted first lookup, an interrupted workspace no longer hangs shutdown, shell commands keep their final output when a process exits quickly, local plugins resolve JavaScript-style imports to their TypeScript source, and switching agents keeps the selected free model. Code Archaeology has been removed; Rewind code + chat still takes you back to earlier work. Dialogs have a look of their own, the send button lines up with the composer, the code reviewer is called Vectorscope, crash reports open as editable drafts, and providers without artwork use a neutral Vector icon. The Terms and software licence now include a minimum liability cap. This release is not yet code-signed, so a new install may show an operating-system warning on first launch.",

Turned on in vector github install, code review covers each pull request when it opens and on every push: one summary, and comments on the exact lines, each with a severity and, where it is safe, a fix you can commit from GitHub. It follows your .vector/review.md rules, re-reviews only what changed and says what got fixed, runs locally as vector review and from the desktop app's Pull Requests panel, and every review states its model and cost. The editor follows every agent live, the main agent included; Claude Code, Codex and Cursor chats answer like any other; the 16-agent limit is gone; and every model your providers offer is listed.",

    question: "Does Vector upload my repository?",
    answer:
      "Vector works on a local repository and does not upload it to Vector's servers by default. Prompts, selected files, tool results, and local-memory context can be sent to the model provider you choose; publishing, Git, MCP, and cloud workflows send only the data required by those connected services.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where are model provider keys stored?",

      "Provider credentials are stored with Vector's local application data and are not written into your repository. Keep normal operating-system account security enabled and never paste secrets into repository files.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can several agents work on one repository?",
    answer:
      "Yes, in two ways. Inside one session, Vector's agent starts subagents on its own for big tasks and runs them in the same checkout. For separate responsibilities, create agent workspaces: each works on its own copy or Git worktree, and you decide which changes are reviewed and merged.",

  {
    question: "What is the difference between a subagent and a subagent specialist?",
    answer:
      "A subagent is general purpose: it takes whatever self-contained piece of the task Vector's agent hands it. Vector starts them for big tasks, one per independent part, and does small tasks itself. A subagent specialist is one of eight named agents, such as Review or Debug, with a fixed focus and its own permissions. Agents you define yourself count as custom specialists. Vector uses both on its own, and both appear in the chat and in Background tasks.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a limit on how many subagents Vector runs?",
    answer:
      "No. Vector sets no cap, though it starts subagents only for big tasks. Your computer and your provider's rate limits are the practical limits, and each subagent spends its own tokens. By default, subagents cannot start subagents of their own.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I stop Vector from using subagents?",
    answer:
      "Yes. In the desktop app, switch off General subagents in Settings → Agents. In the terminal, from 1.99.99, set agent.general.disable to true in ~/.config/vector/vector.json, or in a repository's vector.json for that repository only. In the terminal it takes effect the next time you start Vector there. Vector's agent then does the work itself, except parts that fit a subagent specialist, which it can still hand to one. You can also still call a specialist yourself with @ and its name.",

  {
    question: "Do I need an API key?",
    answer:
      "Not for free models. Sign in to Vector to use Free models inside of Vector, provided by Vector at no cost to you while Vector's service has them on, within a daily limit for each account; a limit or an unavailable endpoint stops the request without a paid fallback. Otherwise connect a provider with your own API key or sign in with ChatGPT. Requests to free models whose providers don't train ask OpenRouter to deny data collection, which excludes endpoints OpenRouter records as training on prompts. Free models whose providers may train are labelled \"May train on your prompts\" and are sent only after you accept that once. Providers may keep prompts and outputs under their own policies, and these routing controls do not cover local history or account logging.",
