# Codium implementation notes

Updated October 28, 2026. These notes describe the committed build on `codium`; they do not replace the contract or the owner's tier decisions.

## Recovered state

The handoff's newer Mac-only deviation file and A09 partial patch were unavailable in this workspace. A09 was reconstructed from the committed build contract at `591cd1f0`, especially §4.4, §7.2 and invariant M6. No claim is made that the Mac-only notes were recovered.

## A09 decisions

- Checkout records the terms version actually published on `origin/main`: October 28, 2026 (`4e7ce1ef`). The older legal pages on the Codium branch remain unchanged. A60 still must merge the reviewed legal release, update both effective dates and this checkout version together, and complete the legal review before sales open.
- A separate `purchase-confirmation` outbox action extends the §4.8 action list. Email delivery cannot prevent a paid entitlement from being provisioned. An unavailable email configuration never marks a receipt sent; it retries through the outbox and can become a dead letter for the owner. Receipt contents state the monthly price, immediate start, withdrawal and account cancellation.
- Carry keeps payment provenance through repeated upgrades. A reversal of an earlier source charge removes its remaining carried portion even after another upgrade. The 12-minute true-up subtracts hosted debits applied after the source key was replaced; a retired provider key's limit alone cannot establish its remaining allowance.
- The test-mode key cap applies to the sum of new credits and carry. The live carry formula is unchanged.
- Downgrade creation persists a retry token before creating a schedule. Releasing that schedule through `/change` or the portal's cancellation flow clears the token, so a later attempt creates a fresh schedule rather than reusing a released one.

## Still gated

A09 does not complete A10–A60 or authorize Codium sales. Risk handling, setup, the new account UI, legal release, payment-provider test-mode end-to-end checks and launch gates remain in their contract order. Existing subscriptions stay manageable through the no-change portal; older plan-change requests receive the account-page link.

## A09 validation

Focused A09 coverage: 21 passing tests, including chained upgrades, source reversals, hosted settlement after replacement, retry consistency, concurrent admission, downgrade interruption and consent. Existing billing, outbox, pool, renewal, replay and mode files pass individually. The HTTP billing integration file passes 42 tests against a real local Valkey, including desktop/web authentication and the ten-per-hour plan-change limit. Total: 230 passing tests. The six initially skipped Valkey-only cases in billing, outbox and replay subsequently passed against an ephemeral local Valkey server; each file ran alone and the server was stopped afterward. API typecheck passes from `packages/engine` using `bun typecheck --project ../../tsconfig.json`.

A safety review checked money, privacy and retry behavior separately from the implementation. Sales, deployments, Stripe, OpenRouter and customer repositories were not changed; all service boundaries in the tests are local fakes.

## Next phase order and external gates

Continue one work package per tested commit; do not open sales after P2 alone.

1. **A10 risk:** add the first-high-value 3-D Secure decision to both checkout paths, actionable early-fraud refunds, dispute collection pause/unpause/cancel, and the trust/pool-ramp outbox action. The current code records risk and disables access; it does not yet perform all those Stripe writes. Exercise the matrix and older-charge cases against fakes. The acceptance check that Stripe subscription-mode Checkout accepts the chosen 3DS field remains a protected test-mode end-to-end job.
2. **A11 switches and funding:** extend the existing switch reader and owner sender with the 30-second cache/audit, collection pause/resume, funding history/runway, low-water/watchdog/spike alerts. Sales-off must not stop renewals or already-paid upgrades. Test every refusal and time boundary locally with fakes.
3. **A12 owner controls:** add the private owner page and endpoints. Require the existing Google-owner identity and fresh OAuth `amr` for mutations; a refreshed token's `iat` cannot satisfy that rule. Show account IDs rather than email addresses and test both authorization and mutation audit.
4. **A13 spend webhook:** verify the raw-body HMAC, email only for the main team, escalate hosted flags at 75%/100%, and atomically refuse de-escalation from a late event. Never invoke a provider pause/deployment API.
5. **A14 setup:** revise dry-run/setup scripts, environment examples and crons together. Remove the obsolete change portal, ensure exactly the reviewed webhook event list, reject runtime restricted keys for setup, and add the explicit `CODIUM_STRIPE_AUTOMATIC_TAX` switch. Only fake `--apply` tests run during implementation; the owner runs the actual setup.

The ordinary Codium CI lane already ran before this work, so further branch pushes do not require asking again for a previously granted CI policy. Its external protected end-to-end job still needs the owner's `codium-test` environment, test secrets and approval. Before sales, owner tasks also include Stripe verification/products/runtime permissions/dashboard settings and tax choice, the separate preview store and deployment protection, funding/auto-top-up, OpenRouter privacy and resale checks, and the reviewed legal release. Hardware, new hosted services, account settings, purchases and deployment are not prerequisites for implementing these five packages with local fakes.

As A10 registers the remaining real outbox handlers, update unit tests that currently use `pool-ramp`/`pause-collection` as synthetic handlers; preserve production's refusal to register duplicate handlers.
