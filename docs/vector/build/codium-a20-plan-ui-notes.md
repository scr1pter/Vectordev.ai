# A20 app and desktop plan UI: implementation record

This work builds on `2722736d` (A19) in `codium-next`. It covers spec §5 A20, the listing and `vector models` line moved
from A19 (coordinator decision, 30 Oct; "Moved to A20" in [codium-a19-clients-notes.md](codium-a19-clients-notes.md)),
and that record's "Obligations for A20 and later". It is **not** a completeness claim: the change is committed as one commit
and pushed to `codium-next` and `codium` (see "Final gate"), no GitHub CI run of it has been seen, and the items under
"Remaining" are open.
No provider request, Stripe, OpenRouter or GitHub call, account setting, deployment or release-catalog change was
made. Every service in the tests is an in-process fake or a loopback fake. No `api/` file changed, so no
`api/_lib/model-plan-*.ts` edit is listed. No public Protocol, HttpApi or schema file changed, so no generator ran
(A19 already generated `ModelCodium`, `UserMessage.selected` and `Session.Error.Codium.code`). Scratch and XDG roots
lived under `/tmp/vector-codium-A20/`.

### Second step: forced models reads and Auto on direct paths

The continuation closed the two code items the first step left open (plan step 11 a/b and Auto on direct-model
paths) and extended the image-routing spec.

`SessionDistill` needed no change: it runs its one request through `SessionPrompt.prompt`, whose `createUserMessage`
resolves Auto for the message before anything is sent, so Auto never reaches its transport. Its estimate names Codium
Auto and checks the window Auto's listing gives.

### Third step: helper agents configured on Codium Auto

The continuation closed the one code gap the second step found: a helper agent whose own `model` is
`vector-plan/vector/codium-auto` went straight to `getModel`, which hands back the listing entry, and the Codium
transport then refused it locally (`CODIUM_AUTO`; nothing sent or charged, but no title or summary either).

| `packages/engine/src/provider/provider.ts`         | `getSmallModel(planID)` and a `small_model` naming Auto share one layer-local reader (`codiumHelper`: `refreshCodium({ wait: true })`, then `CodiumAuto.helper`), so the Codium branch reads the listing itself, as `getModel` does, and answers for a caller that has no Codium conversation. The `fromModelPlans` doc comment now says every entry is listed with its `codium` metadata (it still described A19's interim listing).                                                                             |

The free stack's in-process `LLM.stream` now calls `answering` at its first event, as the real one does, since a title waits for it. |

### Fourth step: review findings on the uncommitted change

A review of the uncommitted tree raised nine findings; each was checked against the code and all nine held up, so all
are fixed below. The two on a failed turn's billing buttons (no later reads, a failure shown nowhere) share one fix, as
do the two on its plan read (suspending the page, one read per card). The test-coverage one is fixed by a handler-level
test and a narrower test name. None was rejected or deferred.

### Fifth step: second review of the uncommitted change

A second review raised six findings; each was checked against the code and all six held up, so all are fixed below.
Three were reproduced by a test that failed before its fix (the automatic compaction, the `small_model` and the review
catalog cases); the other three by reading the code paths named in the finding. None was rejected or deferred.

### Sixth step: third review of the uncommitted change

A third review raised five findings; two of them (the shared plan read keyed by the bridge object, and that read keeping
a failure) are one defect, so four fixes follow, with their browser cases. All held up against the code; none was rejected or deferred. The
shared read was reproduced by two new vector-account cases that fail on the bridge-keyed read; the plans dialog cases
and the image-routing gap were read from the code paths the findings name and are covered by new browser cases (CI
only).

## Tests

Every file below ran on its own from its package, through `/home/user/.tools/vector-serial`, `--timeout 30000`

Third step (final tree), each on its own as above:

Fourth step (final tree), each on its own as above:

| File                                                      | Result                       |

The new `model-plans` case ("a recent Codium model the plan no longer includes is never the default …") failed on the
tree before the `defaultModel` fix (it got `vendor/locked`) and passes after it. `dialog-select-model.test.ts` (it
imports the changed plans dialog) ran again: 51 pass, 0 fail (277 expects). `provider.test.ts` (the general
`defaultModel` cases) ran again: 120 pass, 1 fail, the same "configured model whose provider this version no longer
offers" case described above, on the configured-model fallback the recent-entry change does not reach.

`packages/engine/test/provider/provider.test.ts` (the general `getSmallModel` cases) ran too: 120 pass, 1 fail. The
failure, "defaultModel skips a configured model whose provider this version no longer offers" (expects `anthropic`,
gets `amazon-bedrock`), fails the same way with `provider.ts` put back to `HEAD` for the run, so it does not come from
this change; which ambient setting in this sandbox lists Amazon Bedrock was not looked into (that would mean reading
the environment). It is left for CI to confirm.

"Not changed": neither the file nor the code it covers changed in the second step, so it was not run again. The
engine server files run the real route graph (`auth-create`) or the root routes with mocked services (the other three,
which now also mock `FreeModels.CredentialsService` and `ModelPlans.Service`); none starts a nested process.

Mutation checks (each reverted from a backup outside the worktree, and the file's suite rerun green):

- Routing filter (`codiumTarget` returning true): both new task-intelligence cases fail.
- Swarm filter (`automaticCodium` always true): both new swarm cases fail; dropping the locked-primary refusal fails
  the second.
- Desktop client check (`tokenClient(...) === "never"`): the new desktop-only grant case fails.
- Picker guard (`pickModel` never calling `plans`): the dialog-select-model locked-choice case fails.
- Run-loop Auto resolution (the block disabled): the new codium-auto case "the turn after a shell message that kept
  Auto picks once …" fails (14 pass, 1 fail).
- Second step, forced read: joining the read under way (`pending ??=`), keeping an overtaken read's answer, and not
  resetting `expires` each fail the core "a forced read starts after what changed the plan" case.
- Second step, desktop: `refreshModels` outside the queue fails both race cases; reading the token when asked rather
  than when run fails the sign-out case and the account-switch case.
- Second step, app: dropping the generation check after the models read fails "one a newer purchase overtook
  announces nothing".
- Second step, engine: no Auto resolution in `Agent.generate` fails both codium-generate cases; `generateObject` for
  Codium fails the first; no `small_model` Auto branch fails the new provider case.
- Third step: treating the title agent's Auto as its own model (`own = ag.model`) fails the title case; keeping the old
  skip test (`!ag.model`, `input.providerID`) fails it too, since the title then goes to the conversation's own model
  when the plan has no Auto; dropping the compaction agent's Auto branch fails both compaction cases.
- Fourth step: `runBilling` re-reading only on `completed` fails the codium-error confirm-payment case and the
  vector-account runBilling case; no shared plan read (`codiumSubscribed` always reading) fails the vector-account
  shared-read case; the card's portal buttons back on the old direct `billing(...).then(codiumChanged)` fail the three
  new codium-error cases; `authSet` checking the wrong provider ID fails both httpapi-auth-codium cases.

The files Prettier reformatted after their first pass were run again and passed with the counts above.

Typechecks, each through `vector-serial`, all exit 0 on the final tree of each step (run again after the second):
`packages/core` `bun typecheck`; `packages/app` `bun typecheck` and `bun typecheck:e2e`; `packages/desktop`,
`packages/tui` and `packages/engine` `bun typecheck`. The third step changed only engine files and reran
`packages/engine` `bun typecheck` (exit 0). The fourth step reran `packages/app` `bun typecheck` and
`bun typecheck:e2e`, `packages/tui` and `packages/engine` `bun typecheck` (all exit 0; core and desktop did not change).
Prettier `--check` passes on every changed file.

Fifth step (final tree), each on its own as above (the app files without `--isolate` except `dialog-select-model`):

| File                                                                    | Result                                                                |

| `packages/engine/test/acp/config-option.test.ts`                        | 17 pass, 0 fail (22 expects)                                          |
| `packages/engine/test/session/codium-auto.test.ts`                      | 19 pass, 0 fail                                                       |
| `packages/engine/test/provider/model-plans.test.ts`                     | 15 pass, 0 fail                                                       |
| `packages/engine/test/session/compaction.test.ts`                       | 67 pass, 1 skip (the file's own `it.live.skip`), 0 fail (173 expects) |

Fifth-step mutation checks, each reverted from a backup outside the worktree: without the run loop passing
`selected`, the new codium-auto case "a session on Auto that compacts by itself stays on Auto" fails (the marker has no
`selected`); returning the locked `small_model` fails the new model-plans case (it gets `vector-plan/vendor/locked`);
without the `reviewCatalog` filter the new ai-review case fails; a `newestRead` that always answers newest fails the new
vector-account case; checking validity before removal fails the new TUI favorites case. The ACP case asserts option
names only the badge change produces. Typechecks, through `vector-serial`, exit 0: `packages/app` `bun typecheck` and
`bun typecheck:e2e`, `packages/tui` and `packages/engine` `bun typecheck` (core and desktop did not change). Prettier
also reflowed unrelated lines of `home.tsx` and `ai-review.test.ts`, which were already unformatted at `HEAD`; those
hunks were put back so the diff holds only this step's lines, so `prettier --check` still flags those two files for
the lines this step did not write. Every other file this step changed passes `--check`.

Sixth step (final tree), each on its own as above, without `--isolate` except `dialog-select-model`:

| File                                                                    | Result                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `packages/app/src/vector-account.test.ts`                               | 13 pass, 0 fail (63 expects)  |
| `packages/app/src/components/codium-billing.test.ts`                    | 13 pass, 0 fail (54 expects)  |
| `packages/app/src/components/codium-error.test.ts`                      | 11 pass, 0 fail (74 expects)  |
| `packages/app/src/utils/task-intelligence.test.ts`                      | 16 pass, 0 fail (116 expects) |
| `packages/app/src/components/dialog-select-model.test.ts` (`--isolate`) | 51 pass, 0 fail (277 expects) |

Sixth-step mutation check, reverted from a backup outside the worktree: the shared read keyed by nothing but its age
(as the bridge-keyed read behaves, since the bridge never changes) fails both new vector-account cases, "the shared
answer belongs to the account signed in" and "a failed read answers no plan … and the next card asks again".
Typechecks, through `vector-serial`, exit 0: `packages/app` `bun typecheck` and `bun typecheck:e2e` (no other package
changed in this step). Prettier `--write` left every file this step touched formatted.

## Benchmark (packages/app/AGENTS.md)

No session or timeline file changed (`pages/session/*` is untouched; the restore of `selected` lives in
`context/local.tsx`), but the earlier "not applicable" understated it: `CodiumError` renders in every timeline error row
of a Codium failure, and the first version of its plan read suspended the session page (fourth step). That read is now
a signal from one shared, minute-long read (`codiumSubscribed`), so a card mount neither suspends nor starts a request
of its own; since the sixth step it also asks the desktop's in-memory `status()` (an IPC call, no network) for whose
account the shared read is. No production benchmark was recorded: it needs the app and server running, which this lane's rules forbid
here. Timeline rendering with Codium error rows therefore still wants the packages/app benchmark (baseline against
`2722736d`) in CI or by the owner before release; it is listed under "Remaining".

## Not provider acceptance

`ROUTE_ACCEPTANCES` stays empty, so production `/models` lists no model and every listing, badge and picker behaviour
here is verified against fixtures only. Sol stays staged. Nothing here is acceptance of Stripe's upgrade checkout,
portal card update or 3-D Secure confirmation in the billing window (A60, the protected test-mode lane).

## CI only

- `packages/app/e2e/regression/account-settings.spec.ts` (Playwright), including the `page.clock` 5/20/60 s reads with
  one models read before each, and the card buttons; the fourth step's cases (the card inside `<Suspense>` while its
  plan read is held, the card's Update card and Settings' Confirm payment reads, an upgrade's progress line);
  `codium-image-routing.spec.ts` with the new entry kinds (the guard itself is exercised only by the two cases with a
  Codium text model chosen; the first case shows the older filter), and the sixth step's plans dialog cases (held and
  failed status reads, Keep my plan); locally only `bun typecheck:e2e`.
- `packages/engine/test/session/prompt.test.ts` and `packages/engine/test/cli/vector-account-usage.test.ts` (nested
  Bun processes), the HttpApi exerciser, `check:generated` and the typecheck matrix in `vector-codium.yml`.
- Electron behaviour of the billing window and IPC, `vector-account-refresh-models` included, and
  `packages/desktop/src/main/vector-account.integration.test.ts` (it spawns Bun).
- A forced read against the real `/models`: no test or step here calls vectordev.ai (engine tests set
  `VECTOR_DISABLE_MODELS_FETCH`; the client tests use in-process fakes).

## Review items not taken, and why

- A forced Codium catalog read on a credential write, a desktop `refreshModels` and its race tests (plan step 11 a/b,
  critique items 1 and 2): left open by the first step, built in the second (above). The schedule
  (`refreshAfterPurchase`) stays module-level, so it survives the dialog closing, and `createCodiumBilling` still adds
  no `useServerSync`, so the P2 fixture (Platform and Dialog providers only) still mounts; providers are re-read by the
  app layout's `onCodiumChange` subscription. Critique item 10 (Auto on direct-model paths) is built too.
- The swarm reading follows the review: an unlocked primary the person chose stays (Auto or manual-only); only a
  locked primary is refused.

## Final gate

- **Tree.** `git status` before the commit showed only the A20 source, test, fixture and doc files listed in the
  tables above (67 changed, 4 new: this record and the three new engine tests `agent/codium-generate.test.ts`,
  `cli/models-codium.test.ts` and `server/httpapi-auth-codium.test.ts`). It also showed 24 untracked Bun transpiler
  cache files under `packages/app/bun/@t@/` (`*.pile`, written by a sixth-step test run); they were deleted, not
  committed, and the reruns below did not recreate them. Backups, logs and XDG roots stay outside the worktree
  (`/tmp/vector-codium-A20/`). No `api/` file, no cloud-agent file and no generated file changed.
- **Last edit re-checked.** The last source edits were the sixth step's app files (`vector-account.ts` and its test,
  the plans dialog and billing files, the two browser specs and their fixture). Rerun after them, through
  `vector-serial`, `--timeout 30000`, with fresh XDG and `VECTOR_TEST_HOME` roots under `/tmp/vector-codium-A20/gate/`:
  `src/vector-account.test.ts` 13 pass, 0 fail (63 expects); `src/components/codium-billing.test.ts` 13 pass, 0 fail
  (54 expects); `src/components/codium-error.test.ts` 11 pass, 0 fail (74 expects);
  `src/components/dialog-select-model.test.ts` (`--isolate`) 51 pass, 0 fail (277 expects); `packages/app`
  `bun typecheck:e2e` exit 0. Every other file's last pass is recorded in the sections above and none of them changed
  after it. Only this record and the A19 record's status line changed after these reruns.
- **Push.** The commit is pushed through `vector-serial` to `codium-next` and then `codium` (both fast-forwards from
  `2722736d`); the pre-push hook typechecks every package one at a time, `packages/app` `bun typecheck` included. The
  push to `codium` starts the scoped `vector-codium.yml` workflow on its own; no workflow is dispatched by hand, and
  its result is not recorded here.

## Remaining (open)

1. **CI.** Nothing here has run in GitHub CI: the account-settings and image-routing browser specs (including the
   5/20/60 s `page.clock` reads and the step 0 low-usage expectation that failed run 41138356775), `prompt.test.ts`,
   `vector-account-usage.test.ts`, the desktop integration test, the HttpApi exerciser, `check:generated` and the
   typecheck matrix. The push to `codium` starts the scoped `vector-codium.yml` workflow on its own (see "Final
   gate"); its result is not recorded here.
2. **A16 server hardening.** A purpose-stripped code minted and consumed as a desktop grant stays valid until it
   expires; checking the expected purpose before consuming the code (`api/account/cli-exchange.ts`,
   `api/_lib/desktop-account.ts`) is A16's, and A20 touches neither file. The desktop refuses to keep a grant that is
   not `client: "desktop"`.
3. **WSL servers keep their list for up to a minute** (accepted limit, not a code gap). `refreshModels` writes only
   the app's own sidecar; a WSL engine holds the account only in its environment (`VECTOR_CLI_TOKEN`), so its 5 and
   20 s reads after a purchase may still show the kept list. A write would restart it (`replaceAccount`) or store the
   token on the WSL disk, and a refresh-only route would be a new public HttpApi route; its kept list lapses by the 60
   s read.
4. **Not checkable here:** Stripe's upgrade checkout return, the portal's card update return and a 3-D Secure
   confirmation from the portal home in the billing window (A60).
5. **App benchmark.** packages/app/AGENTS.md asks for a production benchmark around session and timeline changes. No
   `pages/session/*` file changed, but `CodiumError` renders in Codium error rows, so a timeline benchmark with such
   rows (baseline `2722736d`) should run in CI or with the owner; this sandbox may not start the app or server.
